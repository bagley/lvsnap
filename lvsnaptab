# This file is used by the lvsnap script to provide the name of
# the volumes which should be snapped, the location that the
# snaps should be mounted, and the amount of space that should
# be allocated to the snapshot.
#
# The snaps will be created and mounted in the order listed and
# unmounted and destroyed in the reverse order.
#

# Currently this file requires 5 parameters for each volume:
#
# Field 1 - <LV or bind source> - This field should be the name of
# the logical volume which should be snapped, or the source mount point
# for bind mounts
#
# Field 2 - <Dest mount point> - This field defines the directory where
# the given snapshot or bind source will be mounted
#
# Field 3 - <fstype> - This field is currently unused but may eventually
# be used to improve support and options for other filesystems
#
# Field 4 - <mounttype> - This field defines if the given line defines a
# LV snapshot or a bind mount
#
# Field 5 - <snapspace> - This field defines the amount of space allocated
# to the LV snapshot (it is not required for bind mounts).  It is passed as
# a direct to the lvcreate -L|--size  parameter and thus can be in any
# format that this parameter accepts.
# lvcreate lists the syntax as "-L|--size LogicalVolumeSize[kKmMgGtTpPeE]}"
	
# Example LVM snapshot
# /dev/vg/lv	/mnt/snapback  	    ext3  snap  2G
#
# Example bind mount
# /boot 	/mnt/snapback/boot  	ext3  bind
# /var	/mnt/snapback/var	btrfs	bsnap	2G
# /usr	/mnt/snapback/usr	ext3	snap	3G
