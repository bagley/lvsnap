# This file is used by the lvsnap script to provide the name of
# the volumes which should be snapped, the location that the
# snaps should be mounted, and the amount of space that should
# be allocated to the snapshot.
#
# The snaps will be created and mounted in the order listed and
# unmounted and destroyed in the reverse order.
#

# Currently this file requires 5 parameters for each volume:
#
# Field 1 - <LV or bind source> - This field should be the name of
# the logical volume which should be snapped, or the source mount point
# for bind mounts
#
# Field 2 - <Dest mount point> - This field defines the directory where
# the given snapshot or bind source will be mounted
#
# Field 3 - <fstype> - This field defines the filesystem. Currently 
# supported filesystems are ext3, ext4, btrfs, and xfs.
#
# Field 4 - <mounttype> - This field defines if the given line defines a
# LV snapshot or a bind mount
#
# Field 5 - <snapspace> - This field defines the amount of space allocated
# to the LV snapshot (it is not required for bind mounts).  It is passed as
# a direct to the lvcreate -L|--size  parameter and thus can be in any
# format that this parameter accepts.
# lvcreate lists the syntax as "-L|--size LogicalVolumeSize[kKmMgGtTpPeE]}"
	
# Example LVM snapshot with ext3
# /dev/vg/lv	/mnt/snapback  	    ext3  snap  2G

# Example LVM snapshot with ext4
# /dev/vg/lv	/mnt/snapback  	    ext4  snap  2G

# Example LVM snapshot with xfs
# /dev/vg/lv	/mnt/snapback  	    xfs   snap  2G

# Example bind mount
# /boot 	/mnt/snapback/boot  	ext3  bind

# Example of btrfs snapshot (no LVM is needed)
# /var	/mnt/snapback/var	btrfs	bsnap	2G
