This program makes LVM and Btrfs snapshots of filesystems. This can be useful for for snapshotting a system to back it up.

It supports:
- LVM snapshots of ext3, ext4, and xfs
- Btrfs snapshots
- Binding

The snapshot/bind configurations are in lvsnaptab. See it for examples.

The main file is the `lvsnap` which you will need to put in your path. Then save your `lvsnaptab` file to `/usr/local/etc/lvsnaptab`, or you can change it in `lvsnap`:
# Location of the lvsnap configuration file
LVSNAPTAB=/usr/local/etc/lvsnaptab

Once you have configured that, run:
lvsnap start

To stop the binds/snapshots:
lvsnap stop

Modifications to the original lvsnap program, which was written by Tom Sightler.
